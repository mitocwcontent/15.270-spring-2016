Course Description
------------------

_15.270 Ethical Practice: Leading Through Professionalism, Social Responsibility, and System Design_ introduces seminar participants to aspects of ethics in business, with a focus on general management. Over 13 sessions, students explore both the philosophy driving business ethics and the daily challenges that managers face; they also engage on the subject with guest faculty and business and other professional practitioners. Individual sessions take the form of moderated discussion, with occasional short lectures from the instructor.

"Ethical Practice" walks participants through three ever-wider circles of ethical complexity:

1.  Individual, professional commitments
2.  The rights and responsibilities of corporations
3.  The social, ethical underpinnings of business as an activity. We seek to define terms central to each of these circles, culminating in a brief historical assessment of business and capital in the early twenty-first century.
